Recommendation: Add the jira binary directory to your $PATH environment variable ($ export PATH=$PATH:/home/<user>/go/bin/)


== Configuration

=== First step: Creating an access token

1. In Jira (https://issues.redhat.com/), select your profile picture at the top right of the screen, then choose Profile. Once you access your profile, select Personal Access Tokens in the left-hand menu.
2. Select Create token.
3. Give your new token a name.
4. Optionally, for security reasons, you can set your token to automatically expire after a set number of days.
5. Click Create.


=== Second step: Setting the environment variables

. Set the JIRA_API_TOKEN environment variable to your access token:

    $ export JIRA_API_TOKEN=<token>

. In addition to this, set JIRA_AUTH_TYPE env to bearer:

    $ export JIRA_AUTH_TYPE=bearer

. Tip: For using the tool seamlessly without need to define the variable repeatedly, add the variables to a file in your home (e.g. ~/.config/jira with 0600 permissions) and set alias in your .bashrc command that sources the file and then runs the tool: "alias jira='source ~/.config/jira ; $HOME/go/bin/jira'.

=== Third step: Running jira init

. Execute jira init:

    $ jira init

. Select installation type as Local
. Set the link to Jira server to: https://issues.redhat.com
. Login username: Provide your Jira login name (user@redhat.com)
. Default project: RHELPLAN (recommendation)
. Default board: “All my JIRA tickets [PnT]” (recommendation)
. Done, the config file required by the tool should have been generated.


== Utilization
